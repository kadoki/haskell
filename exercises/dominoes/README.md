# Dominoes

Make a chain of dominoes.

Compute a way to order a given set of dominoes in such a way that they form a
correct domino chain (the dots on one half of a stone match the dots on the
neighbouring half of an adjacent stone) and that dots on the halfs of the stones
which don't have a neighbour (the first and last stone) match each other.

For example given the stones `21`, `23` and `13` you should compute something
like `12 23 31` or `32 21 13` or `13 32 21` etc, where the first and last numbers are the same.

For stones 12, 41 and 23 the resulting chain is not valid: 41 12 23's first and last numbers are not the same. 4 != 3

Some test cases may use duplicate stones in a chain solution, assume that multiple Domino sets are being used.


## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
